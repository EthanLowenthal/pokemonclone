#Pokemon Thing
####A game useing the [pokemon api](http://pokeapi.co/)

###Getting
Installing pygame is a major pain in the ass on mac. I fugured it out, so you can too. (I'm to lazy to actually put up instructions)

otherwise:
```sh
pip install reqirements.txt
```

###Running
```sh
arch -32 python window.py 
```
(it has to run in 32 bit for text to work)
