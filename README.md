#Pokemon Game
####A game useing the [pokemon api](http://pokeapi.co/)

###Getting
```sh
git clone https://github.com/kehillah-coding-2017/json-api-EthanLowenthal.git
```
Installing pygame is a major pain in the ass on mac. I fugured it out, so you can too. (I'm to lazy to actually put up instructions)

[here some dude explained it pretty well](http://brysonpayne.com/2015/01/10/setting-up-pygame-on-a-mac/)

for the other packages:
```sh
pip install -r reqirements.txt
```

###Running
```sh
arch -32 python window.py 
```
(it has to run in a 32 bit architecture)

####I did not write the code for the srolling screen but other than that, I created the maps and pretty much every thing else.
