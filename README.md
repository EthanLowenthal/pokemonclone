#####Windows, Unix, Nokia, BeOS, Android (not mac)
[Pygame Downloads](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)

#####Mac
While there are downloads for pygame on mac [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml), I found it only worked the way I wanted it to about 25% of the time. I recomend trying to install from one of the downloads first and if that dosnt work, follow the link below.

[here some dude explained it pretty well](http://brysonpayne.com/2015/01/10/setting-up-pygame-on-a-mac/)

^^^ WARNING: It works, but it screwed up the path on my terminal, so make shure that is saved^^^


for the other packages:
```sh
pip install -r reqirements.txt
```

###Running
```sh
arch -32 python2 window.py 
```
**(it has to run in a 32 bit architecture and is only tested in python2)**

####I did not write the code in gui.py but other than that, I created pretty much every thing else. 


Stuff I take inspiration (and sometimes code) from:
